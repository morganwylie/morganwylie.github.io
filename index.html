	<h2>Modifications</h2>
		<br>
		<p>In the iliad there are a few different language choices that might confuse new readers, the most notably being that the Greeks are not referred to as such. They are called the Achaeans. Similarly the poem is split into books, not chapters.</p>

	<h2>Translations</h2>
		<br>
		<p>The original poem is written in an ancient Greek language, and has been translated hundreds of times. These different translations have the same major plot point but differ in the subtleties. If you want to read it as close to the original as possible, translations like <i>Lattimore</i> and <i>Wilson</i> are often referenced as relatively faithful. Its difficulties come with the language used, difficult and irregular. If you just want to enjoy the story and do not worry too much about the accuracy, translations like <i>Fagles</i> may be for you, but these simpler versions often lack the same depth and metaphorical language as others. So it is important to know what type of experience you want from The Iliad before choosing a translation.</p>
<br>
		<p>With all this settled, now you can continue through this website or the Iliad itself.</p>
