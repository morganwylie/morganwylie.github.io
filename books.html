		<h1 class="dot"><span style="color: #442A56;">• </span><span style="color: #DBAB5F;">• </span><span style="color: #4D5D23;">•</span></h1>
			<p>The story opens in the ninth year of the war. A priest of Apollo, Chryses, is pleading with Agamemnon to return his daughter Chryseis. When refused Chryses prays to Apollo, who shoots arrows of plague onto the Achaeans. Calchas the prophet tells Agamemnon he must give the girl back or else the Greeks will lose. Agamemnon bitterly agrees but says he will take Briseis, a woman taken by Achilles as a prize,  as compensation. Achilles is held back by Athena and withdraws from the war. Achilles complains to his mother Thetis who tells Zeus to back the Trojans.</p>

			<p>The second book acts as an introduction to the most important characters in the Iliad. It is a bit of a drag but also contains important and fun details of the war. Following Thetis' request to fail the Achaeans, Zeus sends Agamemnon a message in his dreams that if he launches a full scale attack on Troy immediately, he will win. Agamemnon jumps up to oblige but first tests his men by telling them to give up the war. Betraying his beliefs, the majority of the Greeks run to their ships to begin preparing to sail back until Odysseus convinces them to come back. After this Homer gives a long list of the Achaeans warriors, then the Trojans</p>

Hector chastises his brothers cowardice so Paris returns to the battle to offer a duel. Menelaus and Paris will fight to the death and whoever wins will have Helen, meaning the war will end. Helen discusses some of the Achaean warriors with Priam, notably mentioning Greater Ajax, Agamemnon, and Odysseus. Priam then retreats, not wanting to witness Paris’ potential death. The two fight and Menelaus ends up dragging Paris through the dirt and choking him by his helmet strap. Aphrodite flies down and saves Paris, to everybody's dismay. Aphrodite then takes Helen to Paris’ bedroom in which they lie down in bed together while the warriors search for Paris. Agamemnon claims Menelaus as the winner by default.</p>
