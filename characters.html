		<h1>Achaeans</h1>
	<br>
		<h3>Achilles</h3>
		<br>
		<p>The central character in The Iliad. King of the Myrmidons and the most powerful warrior. His mother dipped him in the River Styx and he was made immortal apart from heel, this is where the term ‘Achilles’ Heel’ comes from. Achilles is hot-headed and easy to anger, proven with how he is brought to violence in the very first book.</p>

		<h3>Agamemnon</h3>
		<br>
<p>King of Mycenae. Agamemnon leads the Achaean army. Wealthy and Arrogant, Agamemnon’s leadership choices are questionable. He is crude and tactless.</p>
		<img src="Agamemnon.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Agamemnon with his beard and spear">
		
		<h3>Patroclus</h3>
		<br>
<p>Known mostly as Achilles' closest friend and lover in lots of translations and adaptations. He acts as an advisor for the other with a level-head, however he is ultimately slain by Hector after wearing Achilles’ armor to inspire the Greeks.</p>
		<img src="Patroclus.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing tan skinned Patroclus holding his spear wearing Achilles helmet">
		
			<h3>Odysseus</h3>
		<br>
<p>The protagonist of Homer’s The Odyssey, Odysseus is known as the cunning King of Ithaca. Odysseus and Nestor are regarded as the persuasive and tactful speakers of the Achaean army.</p>

		<h3>Diomedes</h3>
		<br>
<p>King of Argos and a major fighter in the war. Diomedes is inspired by Athena and injures Ares and Aphrodite in Book 5.</p>
		<img src="Diomedes.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Diomedes with his noticeable strength">
		
		<h3>Great Ajax</h3>
		<br>
<p>One of the strongest Achaeans in the battle, Great Ajax is a commander who duels against Hector many times during the Iliad.</p>
		<img src="Greater_Ajax.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Greater Ajax with very strong arms showing his strength power">
		
		<h3>Little Ajax</h3>
		<br>
<p>Complemented by Great Ajax, little Ajax acts as his swift and nimble fighting partner. Although a common confusion, Great and Little Ajax are not brothers.</p>
		<img src="Lesser_Ajax.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Lesser Ajax showing his short but nimble frame">
	  
		<h3>Nestor</h3>
		<br>
<p>The oldest commander for the Achaeans. Alongside Odysseus the two are advisors and Nestor is known for his wisdom from old age.</p>
		<img src="Nestor.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Nestor pondering with a hand on his beard">
		
		<h3>Menelaus</h3>
		<br>
<p>King of Sparta and brother of Agamemnon. The abduction of his wife Helen is the cause of the Trojan war.</p>
		<img src="Menelaus.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Red headed Menelaus raising his spear in a battle cry">
		
		<h3>Hera</h3>
		<br>
<p>Hera is the Queen of the Gods, and is known as Zeus’ wife. Harbouring a great disdain to the Trojans, Hera often teams up with Athena to aid the Achaeans.</p>
		<img src="Hera.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Hera standing calmly with closed eyes">
	  
		<h3>Athena</h3>
		<br>
<p>Also hating the Trojans, Athena often aids the Achaeans, inspiring most notably Achilles, Odysseus, and Diomedes.</p>
		<img src="Athena.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Athena with her battle armour on and a decorated spear">
	  
		
		<h3>Poseidon</h3>
		<br>
<p>While being a much more influential figure in The Odyssey, Poseidon sides with the Achaens because of his grudge against the Trojans.</p>
		<img src="Posiedon.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Poseidon coming out of the water with a trident and crown">
		
				<h3>Hephaestus</h3>
		<br>
<p>Not referenced much, Hephestus aids the Greeks by forging Achilles strong armour to fight the Trojans after Patroclus is killed by Hector.</p>

<h2>Trojans</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Hector</h3>
		<br>
		<p>A widely respected and skilled warrior, Hector is the elder prince of Troy and holds a contempt for his brother Paris for causing a war on their city. During Book 6 we see Hector’s devotion to his wife Andromache, and his efforts to ensure his son, Astyanax lives a glorious life.</p>
		<img src="Hector.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Hector raising his sword while wearing his shining helmet">
		
			<h3>Priam</h3>
		<br>
		<p>King of Troy. Respected by both sides for his long life as a soldier, and is welcoming to Helen despite his anger at the war. Priam goes to retrieve Hector's body alone and grief stricken.</p>
		<img src="Priam.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Priam looking forlorn">

		<h3>Paris</h3>
		<br>
		<p>One of many prince’s of Troy, Paris is held responsible for the abduction of Helen and hence the Trojan war. He is cowardly and is content to sit in his room with Helen while the Trojans fight for him. However he joins Hector at the end of Book 6 in a wave of inspiration to fight.</p>
		<img src="Paris.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Paris shaking with nerves, showing his cowardly nature">
		
			<h3>Helen</h3>
		<br>
		<p>The wife of Menelaus who has been abducted by Paris for being known as the most beautiful woman in the world. Helen struggles with her self-hatred at the guilt of being the cause of so much suffering from both Achaeans and Trojans.</p>
		<img src="Helen.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Helen smiling warmly and waving while wearng her known pink dress">

			<h3>Andromache</h3>
		<br>
		<p>The mother of Astyanax and devoted wife of Hector.</p>
		<img src="Andromache.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Andromache wearing a veil and stanidng casually">
		
					<h3>Astyanax</h3>
		<br>
		<p>The son of Andromache who is killed by either Neoptolemus or Odysseus after being thrown off the walls of Troy to avoid the future of him avenging his fathers death.</p>
		<img src="Astyanax.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Astyanax wrapped in blankets as a baby">
		
		<h3>Chryses</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Father of Chryseis and loyal priest of Apollo. When Chryseis is taken by Agamemnon and he refuses to return her to her father, Chryses calls for Apollo, who shoots an arrow of disease through the Achaean ships in the first book.</p>
		<img src="Chryses.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Chryses bent over with old age looking weary">
		
		<h3>Briseis</h3>
		<br>
		<p>One of the many women which Achilles keeps as a prize for his victories. Briseis is taken by Agamemnon after he is forced to return Chryseis, which causes Achilles’ hatred of the King to begin and his retaliation and refusal to fight.</p>
		<img src="Briseis.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Brisies adorned in clean light blue robes, showing her status as one of achilles beloved">
		
		<h3>Zeus</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Claiming neutrality for most of the war. However after Agamemnon upsets Achilles, Thetis asks Zeus to help the Trojans per Achilles request.</p>
		<img src="Zeus.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Zeus emerging from the clouds holding a bolt of lightning">
		
		<h3>Thetis</h3>
		<br>
		<p>The prophecy that tells her son will die in the battle, Thetis attempts to aid the Trojans to keep her son alive.</p>
		
	<img src="Thetis.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Thetis the sea nymph with mythical blue skin and green hair, showng her non-human side">
		
			<h3>Apollo</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Known as the god of the sun and specifically music, Apollo heavily favours the Trojans and frequently aids them alongside Aphrodite.</p>
		
		<img src="Apollo.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Apollo grinning while playing the lyre">
		
			<h3>Aphrodite</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Paris, choosing Aphrodite, is the main reason of Aphrodites allegiance to the Trojans. She frequently interferes to help the Trojans, much to the mortals and gods dismay. Most notably she whisks Paris away when he is hurt in a duel between himself and Menelaus.</p>
		<img src="Aphrodite.Jpeg" width="380" alt="cartoon drawing showing Aphrodite looking to the side wistfully in a pink and gold gown">
