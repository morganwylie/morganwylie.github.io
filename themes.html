	<div class="honour">
	<h2>Honour and Glory</h2>
		<br>
		<p>The goal of most soldiers in the war was to have their name be remembered in myths and legends. During the book we meet many soldiers who have had gloryful journey, but are ultimately killed by another character without being mentioned again, fading into obscurity. Solidifying just how rare it is for your life to be remembered.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="divinity">
	<h2>The Divinity of the Gods</h2>
		<br>
		<p>The outcome of the war largely relies on the gods and which side they are backing. This works alongside the theme of free will as it is discussed on how much the war, and the soldiers' endings truly lies on their own actions, or if it all plays on what the gods and goddesses want.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="fate">
	<h2>Fate and Free Will</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Pairing alongside the theme of the gods, the Iliad discusses how much of a human's fate and actions really stem from their own motivation. Since major characters die in this story, many of them die in a way that falls so perfectly in the linear telling that the only possible reason must be godly interference.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="mortality">
	<h2>Mortality</h2>
		<br>
		<p>No human is invincible, no matter how much they think they are. The Iliad shows this by the inevitable deaths of the soldiers. However it highlights their bravery and courage to take the chances they do. The characters embrace the possibility of death at each turn and throw themselves into the battle to prove their honor.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="love">
	<h2>Love and Friendship</h2>
		<br>
		<p>The love between Menelaus, Helen, and Paris is the central conflict of the Iliad, however there are many relationships that influence the outcome of the books and the characters actions. One of the major relationships explored and mentioned in The Iliad and future media inspired from the epic poem is the questioned relationship between Patroclus and Achilles.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="hubris">
	<h2>Hubris</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Arrogance and excessive pride is the downfall of many characters, Achilles, Agamemnon, and Odysseus are some of the main characters who fall to this. The dangers of this way of life is shown with how many of the soldiers' deaths come from biting off more than they can chew.</p>
